<p><strong>Here is what the postponement means for individuals:</strong></p>

<p><strong>1.Â  Â </strong>Individual taxpayers can postpone federal income tax payments for theÂ <strong>2020Â </strong><strong>tax year</strong>Â due onÂ <em>April 15, 2021</em>, toÂ <em>May 17, 2021</em>, without penalties and interest. Penalties and interest will begin to accrue on any remaining unpaid balances as of<em>Â May 17, 2021</em>.</p>

<p><strong>2.</strong>Â  Â Individual taxpayers who need additional time to file beyond theÂ <em>May 17</em>Â deadline can request a filing extension untilÂ <em>Oct. 15</em>. Taxpayers should pay their federal income tax due byÂ <em>May 17, 2021</em>,Â <strong>to avoid interest and penalties</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>3.Â  Â </strong>This relief does not apply to estimated tax payments that are due onÂ <em>April 15, 2021</em>. These payments are still due onÂ <em>April 15</em>.</p>

<p><strong>4.Â  Â </strong>At this time, Hawaii individual tax returns are still due April 20, 2021.Â  We are awaiting additional guidance from the state.Â Â </p>
