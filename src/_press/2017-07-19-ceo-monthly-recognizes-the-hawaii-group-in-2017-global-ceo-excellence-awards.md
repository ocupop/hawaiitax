Chief Executive Officers are the figureheads of a company, and whilst all employees have an important role to play in the success of a firm, ultimately a CEO’s decision can be a pivotal point in a company’s success. Because of the vital part that CEO’s play, the 2017 Global CEO Excellence Awards have been created to recognise the outstanding effort and hard work of the key leaders around the globe.

The Hawaii Group, Inc. (HiGroup) is one of the Asia Pacific region’s fastest growing companies, offering a wide range of business services. The company grew in 2016 to over $200 million in revenues, servicing over 1,000 clients, employing 150 internal employees and over 10,000 external employees.

Matthew Delaney, CEO of HiGroup, believes that his business will thrive only if families prosper. He promised his employees that “family comes first” and he has delivered on that promise. HiGroup’s office is a family-friendly environment where children are welcome and flexible hours allow parents to fulfill their personal responsibilities. HiGroup helps its staff balance work and family obligations. HiGroup also encourages a flexible work schedule to accommodate commuting and childcare demands.

Commenting on the award’s programme, Awards Coordinator Jordan Japel stated: “CEOs drive innovative and success in any company, and as such it is my pleasure to congratulate The Hawaii Group and wish them the best of luck for the future.”
